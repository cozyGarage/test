    "In order to derive knowledge and insights from data, the area of data science integrates statistical analysis, machine learning, and computer programming. It entails gathering, purifying, and converting unstructured data into a form that can be analysed and visualised. Data scientists process and analyse data using a number of methods and tools, such as statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data visualisation software. Data science seeks to uncover patterns in data that can help with decision-making, process improvement, and the creation of new opportunities. Business, engineering, and the social sciences are all included in this interdisciplinary field."

    "Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm. Data preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis."

    "For achieving better results from the applied model in Machine Learning projects the format of the data has to be in a proper manner. Some specified Machine Learning model needs information in a specified format, for example, Random Forest algorithm does not support null values, therefore to execute random forest algorithm null values have to be managed from the original raw data set.\n",
    "Another aspect is that the data set should be formatted in such a way that more than one Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithm are executed in one data set, and best out of them is chosen."
